# Inbound Voice Playbook

## Overview

This playbook covers how to handle inbound voice calls in Webex Connect — specifically, flows triggered when a PSTN caller dials a Connect-provisioned voice number. This is the pattern for IVR menus, caller lookup, and inbound call routing.

**Key distinction from outbound voice flows:** Inbound flows use the **Start node** (Inbound Call trigger) instead of a webhook. There is no Call User node — the call already exists. The Voice Node Group auto-creates from the inbound call trigger, not from a Call User node.

For outbound voice handling, see `outbound-voice.md`.

### Inbound vs. Outbound Comparison

| Aspect | Outbound Voice | Inbound Voice |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Start trigger** | Webhook (external event) | Inbound Call (PSTN ring) |
| **Call initiation** | Call User node (outside VNG) | No Call User — call already exists |
| **Voice Node Group** | Auto-created by Call User node | Auto-created by inbound call trigger |
| **Caller context** | Webhook payload (order_id, phone, etc.) | ANI (caller ID), DNIS (dialed number), timestamp |
| **Use case** | Proactive notifications | Reactive call handling |

---

## 1. Start Node (Inbound Call Trigger)

The **Start node** must be configured with trigger type **Inbound Call**. This fires when a caller dials the voice number assigned to the flow.

### Configuration

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Trigger Type** | Inbound Call |
| **Voice Number** | Select from dropdown of provisioned inbound-capable numbers |

**One trigger per flow.** Each flow has exactly one Start node. To handle multiple voice numbers, create separate flows or use a single number with Branch logic downstream.

### Output Variables

Variables are shown in expression syntax as used inside flow nodes (e.g., `$(n1.voice.msisdn)`). Official docs list bare field names without the wrapper.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$(n1.voice.msisdn)` | Caller's phone number (ANI) |
| `$(n1.voice.serviceNumber)` | Dialed number (the Connect voice number) |
| `$(n1.voice.timestamp)` | Call arrival timestamp (Unix epoch) |
| `$(n1.voice.transId)` | Unique transaction ID |
| `$(n1.voice.offeredOn)` | Call initiation timestamp |
| `$(n1.voice.callType)` | `"IBD"` for inbound (documented for Receive Node missed-call events; unverified for live answered inbound Start trigger) |
| `$(n1.voice.releasedOn)` | Call end timestamp (documented for Receive Node; availability on live inbound Start trigger is unverified) |

---

## 2. Voice Node Group (Inbound)

The **Voice Node Group** auto-creates from the inbound call trigger. Do NOT add a Call User node — doing so creates a second VNG and causes confusion.

### Key Rules

- Up to **1,000 Voice Node Groups** per flow
- Cannot be deleted once created
- **Wait for** and **Delay** nodes are NOT supported inside the group
- Call terminates immediately when any internal node connects to VNG edges (exits the group)
- AMD configurable in VNG settings

### Voice-Specific Nodes (Inside Group)

| Node | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Play** | Play TTS or audio to the caller |
| **Record** | Record caller audio |
| **Collect Input** | Capture DTMF or speech input |
| **IVR Menu** | Multi-option menu with branching |
| **Call Patch** | Bridge caller with another number |
| **Call Transfer** | Blind or warm transfer to another number |

### General-Purpose Nodes (Inside Group)

These non-voice nodes can run inside the group while the call is active:

Evaluate, Branch, HTTP Request, Data Parser, Data Transform, Profile, SMS, WhatsApp, Email, Apple Messages for Business, Messenger, RCS, Generate OTP, Validate OTP, Encryption, Decryption

### Nodes That Must Be OUTSIDE the VNG

- **Start node** — always first, always outside
- **Call User node** — cannot exist inside VNG

---

## 3. Play Node (TTS Greeting)

The **Play node** lives inside the Voice Node Group and plays audio or TTS to the caller. For inbound flows, this is typically a greeting or informational message.

For full TTS configuration details (Azure Neural voices, SSML tags, variable insertion, audio alternatives), see `outbound-voice.md` Section 4 and Section 5.

**Note:** The Play node has no barge-in capability. "Interrupt audio on user input" is a Collect Input node option only — it does not apply to Play.

### Inbound Greeting Patterns

**Plain Text:**
```
Thank you for calling Contoso Property Management. How can we help you today?
```

**SSML:**
```xml
<speak>
  Thank you for calling Contoso Property Management.
  <break time="300ms"/>
  Please listen carefully as our menu options have changed.
</speak>
```

**Dynamic greeting with caller lookup:**
```
Hello $(n3.first_name). Thank you for calling. Your account balance is $(n3.balance).
```

### Play Node Outcomes

| Outcome | When |
|---------|------|
| `onSuccess` | Audio plays without errors |
| `onError` | Playback encounters issues |

---

## 4. Collect Input Node (DTMF / Speech)

The **Collect Input** node captures caller input via DTMF keypress or speech recognition. Use it for IVR menus, account number entry, or speech-driven routing.

### DTMF Configuration

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Input Size** | Maximum characters expected (e.g., `1` for menu selection, `10` for account number) |
| **Termination Character** | Character that ends input early. Options: `None` or `Any character`. Set to `None` when collecting a fixed number of digits. |
| **Input Timeout** | Seconds to wait for input before triggering `oninputTimeout` |
| **Interrupt audio on user input** | Toggle. When enabled, caller input interrupts any playing audio. |

### Speech Configuration

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Input Timeout** | Seconds to wait for speech before triggering `oninputTimeout` |
| **Silence Timeout** | Seconds of silence after speech starts before input is finalized |
| **Engine** | Speech recognition engine |
| **Language** | Recognition language (ISO code) |
| **Enable Recording** | Optional. Records the speech input for review. |

**Note:** Speech input has pricing implications — contact your account manager to discuss commercials before enabling.

### Output Variable

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$(nX.collect.input)` | The collected input (DTMF digits or speech transcription) |

### Exit Paths

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `onSuccess` (green) | Input collected successfully |
| `oninputTimeout` (orange) | Caller did not provide input within the timeout period |
| `onFailure` (yellow) | Input collection failed (e.g., invalid input) |
| `onError` (red) | Collection failed (e.g., configuration error) |

---

## 5. HTTP Request (Mid-Call Data Fetch)

The **HTTP Request** node runs inside the Voice Node Group while the call is active. Use it to look up caller information, query a database, or call an external API mid-call.

### Common Inbound Use Case: Caller Lookup by ANI

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Method** | GET |
| **URL** | `https://your-api.example.com/customers?phone=$(n1.voice.msisdn)` |
| **Headers** | Authorization, Content-Type as needed |

The caller's ANI (`$(n1.voice.msisdn)`) is available from the Start node and can be passed directly into the HTTP Request URL or body.

### Configuration

Same as standard HTTP Request nodes — Method, URL, Headers, Body, Timeout. See the platform HTTP Request documentation for full field reference.

### Exit Paths

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `onSuccess` (green) | HTTP response received (any status code) |
| `onError` (red) | Request failed (timeout, DNS failure, etc.) |

Parse the response status code in a downstream Branch node to handle 200 vs. 404 vs. error cases.

---

## 6. Call Patch Node

The **Call Patch** node bridges the inbound caller (A-party) with a dialed B-party, creating a two-party conversation. It lives INSIDE the Voice Node Group (unlike Call User, which sits outside).

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Destination (B-PARTY)** | Yes | E.164 format. Invalid format exits through `onError`. |
| **Display Number** | No | From Assets > Numbers. Not all carriers support. |
| **Display Name** | No | 10-digit max. Disabled by default. |
| **Play audio to the A party (calling party) while attempting the call patch** | No | Activates Jingle File dropdown |
| **Jingle File** | No | Pre-uploaded audio from Voice Media library |
| **Play audio to the B party (calling party) before patching the call** | No | Activates Announcement File dropdown |
| **Announcement File** | No | Pre-uploaded audio file |
| **Loop audio until DTMF keypress** | No | Repeats announcement. Exits `onNoAnswer` if threshold hit without DTMF. |
| **Looping Threshold** | Conditional | Max loop iterations. Required when looping is enabled. Misconfiguration risks prolonged line occupation. |
| **Transfer DTMFs after call patch** | No | Passes A-party DTMF to B-party post-bridge |
| **Record the call upon successful patching** | No | Saved with prefix + NodeTID |

**IMPORTANT:** There is no explicit ring timeout field. `onNoAnswer` fires based on carrier behavior. The commonly cited range of 30-45 seconds is unverified; no official documentation confirms a specific timeout value.

### Exit Paths

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `onSuccess` (green) | B-party answered and call was bridged |
| `onNoAnswer` (yellow) | B-party did not answer |
| `onError` (red) | Invalid destination or call setup failure |

### Output Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$(nX.patch.APartyNumber)` | The number from which the outbound call is in progress (A-party) |
| `$(nX.patch.BPartyNumber)` | The B-party (patched destination) number |

### Bridge Behavior

The flow pauses while the bridge is active and resumes after one party disconnects. Post-bridge, the flow continues from the `onSuccess` exit — use this to play a post-call message or log the interaction. Post-bridge resumption behavior is not explicitly documented; verify in sandbox before production deployment.

## 7. Voice Channel Prerequisites (Inbound)

### Production Tenants

- **Voice-enabled phone number** with **inbound capability** — purchase/rent via Assets > Numbers. Ensure the number has Inbound enabled.
- **Number assignment** — the voice number must be assigned to the flow's Start trigger. An unassigned number will not route calls to the flow.
- **Flow must be Made Live** — draft flows do not receive inbound calls.

### Sandbox/Testing

- **Two-way voice** (make + receive) available in **USA, Canada, UK only**. Other countries: outbound only, no inbound.
- **Pre-provisioned number** — sandbox provides a voice number automatically.
- **5 test numbers max** — register up to 5 caller phone numbers for testing (same country).
- **5000 inbound calls** — sandbox limit across all flows. Whether inbound and outbound counts are tracked separately is not clarified in official docs.

  |       |
  |       v
  |   Branch (on HTTP status)
  |       |--- 200 → Play ("Hello $(n3.first_name). Your balance is...") → End
  |       |--- other → Play ("We couldn't find your account. Goodbye.") → End
```

## 9. Known Gotchas

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Flow doesn't trigger on inbound call | Voice number not assigned to the flow's Start trigger, or flow not Made Live |
| No Voice Node Group appears | For inbound, the VNG auto-creates from the trigger — don't add a Call User node |
| Caller hears nothing | Play node not wired as first node inside the VNG |
| Call drops immediately | Flow exits the VNG without any nodes — add at least a Play node |
| Sandbox inbound doesn't work | Two-way voice only available in USA, Canada, UK sandbox |
| ANI shows as empty | Caller ID may be blocked; handle the empty-ANI case in the flow |
| DTMF not detected | Collect Input node may need specific codec/DTMF relay settings |
