- Put the call on hold, transfer, or conference
- Request supervisor assistance

These features become available again after the announcement completes.

A whisper announcement:
- Is applicable to incoming calls and blind transfer to EP
- Can be a prompt or text-to-speech (TTS) string
- Can be combined with compliance message and agent greeting, in which case the whisper plays first
- Is not included in the call recording
- Supports all agent endpoint types: phone, soft client, and WebRTC
