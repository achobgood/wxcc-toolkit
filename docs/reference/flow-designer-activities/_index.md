# Flow Designer — Situational Activities Index

> Essential activities (Play Message, Play Music, Set Variable, Queue Contact, Disconnect Contact, Variable Types, Output Variables, Global Events) are in [flow-designer-essentials.md](../flow-designer-essentials.md).
>
> Patterns and advanced topics are in [flow-designer-patterns.md](../flow-designer-patterns.md).

**Adding a new activity:** Create a new `.md` file in this directory (kebab-case name, e.g., `new-activity.md`). Start it with `## Activity Name` as an H2 heading. Then add a row to the table below. Do NOT append to an existing file.
