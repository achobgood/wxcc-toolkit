# Multi-Channel Routing Playbook

## Overview

This playbook covers how to build a single Webex Connect flow that routes notifications to different channels based on customer preference. One webhook, one flow — the customer gets their preferred channel (SMS, Email, Voice, RCS, Apple Messages, or WhatsApp) with automatic SMS fallback when the preferred channel fails.

**This is the premium pattern.** Instead of building separate flows per channel, you build one flow with a Branch node that routes to the right channel at runtime. Adding a new channel means adding one branch — not a new flow.

**Flow structure:**

```
Start (Webhook: customer_id, message, ...)
  → HTTP Request (GET customer record — preferred_channel, phone, email, abc_user_id, abc_session_active)
  → Branch (preferred_channel)
    → "sms"      → SMS → End
    → "email"    → Email → End
    → "voice"    → Call User → Voice Node Group [Play TTS] → End
    → "rcs"      → RCS Capability → Branch (supported?) → RCS Message or SMS fallback → End
    → "apple"    → Branch (session active?) → Apple Messages or SMS fallback → End
    → "whatsapp" → WhatsApp (Template or session) → End
    → default    → SMS (safe fallback) → End
```

## 1. Customer Preference Lookup

Before routing, you need to know the customer's preferred channel. Add an **HTTP Request** node immediately after the Start node to query your customer database.

### HTTP Request Configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `https://{api-base-url}/customers?id=eq.$(n1.inboundWebhook.customer_id)` |
| **Headers** | Add header entry: `Content-Type: application/json` (via "Add Another Header" in the Headers section) |

### Required Output Variables

Extract these fields from the response — the rest of the flow depends on them:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `preferred_channel` | Routing key for the Branch node | `sms`, `email`, `voice`, `rcs`, `apple`, `whatsapp` |
| `phone` | Destination for SMS, Voice, RCS, WhatsApp | `+15551234567` (E.164) |
| `email` | Destination for Email | `customer@example.com` |
| `abc_user_id` | Custom DB column — maps to the `abcId` Apple Messages uses as destination (nullable) | `abc-opaque-id-xyz` |
| `abc_session_active` | Custom DB flag — whether an Apple Messages session is open (not a platform-provided variable; you maintain this) | `true` / `false` |

### Database Schema Pattern

Your customer table needs a `preferred_channel` column. Default it to `sms` so customers without a preference still get routed.

See `connect-multi-channel.md` for the full schema pattern and column definitions.

---

## 2. Branch Node Configuration

The **Branch node** is the routing engine. It reads the customer's `preferred_channel` value and sends the flow down the matching path.

### Step-by-Step Configuration

1. Drag a **Branch** node onto the canvas
2. Wire the HTTP Request node's output to this Branch node
3. Add one branch per supported channel:

| Branch # | Condition | Operator | Value | Routes To |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `$(n2.preferred_channel)` | Equals | `sms` | SMS node |
| 2 | `$(n2.preferred_channel)` | Equals | `email` | Email node |
| 3 | `$(n2.preferred_channel)` | Equals | `voice` | Call User node |
| 4 | `$(n2.preferred_channel)` | Equals | `rcs` | RCS Capability node |
| 5 | `$(n2.preferred_channel)` | Equals | `apple` | Apple Messages session check |
| 6 | `$(n2.preferred_channel)` | Equals | `whatsapp` | WhatsApp node |
| Default | None of the above | — | — | SMS node (universal fallback) |

Where `n2` is the HTTP Request node number — verify this matches your flow's node numbering.

### Case Sensitivity Warning

Branch conditions are **case-sensitive**. `SMS` does not match `sms`. Normalize your `preferred_channel` values to lowercase in your database to avoid misroutes. If a value doesn't match any branch, the "None of the above" default fires — which routes to SMS, so the customer still gets notified.

---

## 3. Channel-Specific Delivery Paths

Each branch leads to a channel-specific delivery path. The SMS and Email paths are straightforward. Voice, RCS, Apple Messages, and WhatsApp require additional nodes or considerations before delivery.

### SMS Path (Simplest)

Direct send — no capability check needed. Every phone supports SMS.

```
Branch (sms) → SMS Node → End
```

Configure the SMS node with `$(n2.phone)` as the destination and your notification text in the message body. Use `$(nX.variableName)` syntax for dynamic values from the HTTP Request output.

### Email Path (Direct Send)

No capability check needed if the customer record includes an email address.

```
Branch (email) → Email Node → End
```

Configure with `$(n2.email)` as the destination. Supports HTML body, attachments, and dynamic subject lines.

### Voice Path (Call User + TTS)

The voice path dials the customer and plays a TTS message.

```
Branch (voice) → Call User → Voice Node Group [Play TTS] → End
```

Configure the Call User node with:
- **Destination:** `$(n2.phone)` (E.164 format)
- **From Number:** Select a provisioned voice-enabled number

The Voice Node Group auto-creates when you add the Call User node. Add a Play node inside it with your TTS message. TTS messages are limited to 2,000 characters.

See `outbound-voice.md` for full Call User configuration, TTS settings, SSML examples, and AMD setup.

### RCS Path (Capability Check Required)

RCS requires a two-node check before sending — not every device supports it, and no iOS devices do.

```
Branch (rcs)
  → RCS Capability (check phone)
    → onSuccess → Branch (rcs.enabled == true AND rcs.version == "up2")
      → [Yes] → RCS Message → End
      → [No]  → SMS (fallback) → End
    → onError → SMS (fallback) → End
```

Configure the RCS Capability node with `$(n2.phone)` and `Force Refresh: false` (cached lookup, near-instant). After the capability check succeeds, add a second Branch node to verify `rcs.enabled` = `true` AND `rcs.version` = `up2` before sending rich content.

See `outbound-rcs.md` for the full capability check pattern, rich card configuration, and SMS fallback wiring.

### Apple Messages Path (Session Check Required)

Apple Messages requires an active customer session — you cannot cold-send. Your HTTP Request already fetched `abc_session_active` from the customer record.

```
Branch (apple)
  → Branch (abc_session_active == true)
    → [Yes] → Apple Messages → End
    →          (wire onError, onPolicyFail → SMS fallback → End)
    → [No]  → SMS (fallback) → End
```

Add a second Branch node that checks `$(n2.abc_session_active)` = `true` (a custom DB flag you maintain — the platform does not provide this variable). If active, send via Apple Messages using `$(n2.abc_user_id)` as the destination (the Destination Type is "AbcUser Id" — `abcId` in platform terms). Wire both `onError` and `onPolicyFail` to SMS — the session can close between the check and the send.

See `outbound-apple-messages.md` for the full session check pattern, Rich Link configuration, and session table design.

### WhatsApp Path (Template or Text Message)

WhatsApp supports two message types: **template messages** (pre-approved by Meta, can be sent anytime) and **Text messages** (non-template, free-form — only within 24 hours of the customer's last inbound message). For proactive notifications, use templates.

```
Branch (whatsapp)
  → WhatsApp Node (template or Text message)
    → onSuccess → End
    → onError → SMS (fallback) → End
    → onPolicyFail → SMS (fallback) → End
    → onTimeout → SMS (fallback) → End
    → onDeliveryReportFail → SMS (fallback) → End
```

Configure the WhatsApp node with `$(n2.phone)` as the destination (E.164 format). For template messages, select the approved template and map dynamic parameters. For Text messages (non-template messages), provide the message body directly.

Wire all WhatsApp failure exits to SMS fallback — `onError`, `onPolicyFail`, `onTimeout`, and `onDeliveryReportFail`. The recipient may not have WhatsApp installed, or the template may have been paused/rejected.

See `outbound-whatsapp.md` for full WhatsApp node configuration, template setup, and session message patterns.

## 4. Failure & Fallback Wiring

Every channel path must have a fallback. SMS is always the **ultimate fallback** — every phone supports it.

### Standard Fallback: Wire `onError` to SMS

Wire each channel's error exit to a shared SMS fallback node (or individual SMS nodes — both work):

| Channel Path | Error Exit | Fallback |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Email | `onError`, `onPolicyFail`, `onTimeout`, `onDeliveryReportFail` | SMS |
| Voice (Call User) | `onbusy`, `onnoanswer`, `onreject`, `oncallfail`, `onExpiry` | SMS (optional — depends on urgency) |
| RCS Capability | `onError` | SMS |
| RCS (Branch: not supported) | "None of the above" | SMS |
| RCS Message | `onError`, `onPolicyFail`, `onTimeout`, `onDeliveryReportFail` | SMS |
| Apple Messages (no session) | "None of the above" | SMS |
| Apple Messages | `onError`, `onPolicyFail` | SMS |
| WhatsApp | `onError`, `onPolicyFail`, `onTimeout`, `onDeliveryReportFail` | SMS |

### RCS Fallback Details

Three SMS fallback wires for the RCS path:
1. **RCS Capability → onError** → SMS (capability check itself failed)
2. **Branch → "None of the above"** → SMS (device doesn't support RCS or only has up1)
3. **RCS Message → onError** → SMS (message send failed after passing checks)

### Apple Messages Fallback Details

Two SMS fallback wires for the Apple Messages path:
1. **Branch → "None of the above"** → SMS (no active session)
2. **Apple Messages → onError / onPolicyFail** → SMS (session closed between check and send, or policy violation)

### Voice Fallback (Optional)

Voice fallback to SMS is optional and depends on notification urgency:
- **For critical notifications:** Wire `onbusy`, `onnoanswer`, and `onExpiry` to SMS so the customer still gets the message
- **For non-critical:** Wire error exits to End — don't double-notify

### Priority-Based Fallback Chain

```
Preferred Channel → Primary Fallback → Ultimate Fallback
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RCS              → SMS              → (done)
Apple Messages   → SMS              → (done)
WhatsApp         → SMS              → (done)
Email            → SMS              → (done)
Voice            → SMS (optional)   → (done)
SMS              → (done)           →
```

For cascade fallback patterns (RCS → Email → SMS), see `connect-multi-channel.md`.

## 6. Known Gotchas

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Customer gets both RCS and SMS | Branch node routes aren't exclusive — ensure the RCS success path does NOT also fall through to the default SMS branch. Each branch exit must wire to its own End node |
| Branch conditions don't match | `preferred_channel` values are case-sensitive. `SMS` ≠ `sms`. Normalize to lowercase in your database |
| Customer with no preference gets nothing | Set the Branch default ("None of the above") to SMS. Also default `preferred_channel` to `sms` in your DB schema |
| RCS path adds 3–6s latency | RCS Capability node with `Force Refresh: true` does a live carrier lookup. Use `Force Refresh: false` for cached lookup (near-instant, 7-day cache). On cache miss, the node automatically falls back to a live lookup |
| Apple Messages sends fail silently | Session closed between your DB check and the send. Wire both `onError` and `onPolicyFail` to SMS fallback |
| Voice call never connects — no error exit fires | Call User `onExpiry` fires (orange exit) when the call request expires before being answered. Wire `onExpiry` to SMS fallback for critical notifications |
| Variable picker shows wrong node's variables | After adding or removing nodes, node numbers shift. Re-verify all `$(nX.variableName)` references match the correct node numbers |
| Flow exceeds 30s when used inside an AI Agent action | Multi-channel routing with RCS + HTTP lookups can exceed the agent timeout. Move notification logic to a separate webhook-triggered flow (this playbook's pattern) instead of embedding in an agent action |
| WhatsApp template rejected at runtime | Template was paused or disabled by Meta after approval. Check template status in **Tools → Templates** within Webex Connect before going live and monitor for status changes |
| WhatsApp Text message fails outside 24-hour window | Customer hasn't messaged in the last 24 hours — Text messages (non-template) only work within that window. Use template messages for proactive outbound, or fall back to SMS |
| SMS fallback node receives duplicate triggers | Multiple error paths wire to the same SMS node. This is fine — Connect handles it. But verify the SMS destination variable resolves correctly from all input paths |
