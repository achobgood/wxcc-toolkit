## Blueprint Composition Patterns

Common combinations from `flow-blueprints.md § Combining Blueprints`.

| Combination | Merge Point | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Business Hours (3) + Simple IVR (1) | Replace 1's NewPhoneContact→Menu with 3's NewPhoneContact→BusinessHours→WorkingHours→Menu | Add closed/holiday exit paths from BP3 |
| Simple IVR (1) + Callback Offer (5) | After Queue Contact in BP1, add BP5's Get Queue Info→Condition→Callback chain | Callback replaces disconnect on high EWT |
| DNIS Routing (2) + Language Selection (7) | After DNIS-based queue selection, add BP7's language menu per branch | Each DNIS branch gets its own language menu, or share one |
| DNIS Routing (2) + Business Hours (3) | After DNIS lookup identifies the store, check that store's business hours | Use Functions to map DNIS→schedule name, then Business Hours |
| AI Agent (11) + Post-Call Survey (8) | BP8 goes in AgentDisconnected event flow; BP11 is the main flow | Survey fires after agent disconnect regardless of main flow |
| Caller Verification (6) + Skill Routing (9) | After CJDS lookup, use verified status to set skill variable | Verified callers get VIP skill routing |
| Business Hours (3) + AI Agent (11) + Callback (5) | BP3 entry → working hours → BP11 → escalation overflow → BP5 | Callback offered when AI agent escalates and queue is long |
| DNIS (2) + Business Hours (3) + IVR (1) | NewPhoneContact→Case(DNIS)→Functions(get store data)→BusinessHours→Menu | Functions returns store-specific schedule name |
| Language Selection (7) OR Single-Menu Multilingual (13) | If >2 activities differ per language, use BP7 (separate menus). If only the TTS prompts change, use BP13 (shared menu with variable prompts). | BP13 avoids duplicating the entire menu tree; BP7 gives full per-language control |

### Composition Rules

1. **One NewPhoneContact per flow.** Only one start node exists — the first blueprint provides the entry; subsequent blueprints connect downstream.
2. **Event handlers are additive.** Each blueprint contributes its relevant event handlers (e.g., BP5 adds CallbackFailed, BP8 adds AgentDisconnected survey).
3. **Variables merge by name.** When combining, deduplicate variables. If two blueprints use the same variable name for different purposes, rename one.
4. **Shared activities merge into one.** If both blueprints have a Queue Contact to the same queue, use one instance. Don't duplicate terminal activities (Disconnect Contact) unnecessarily — but each unique exit path needs its own.
5. **OnGlobalError is always present.** Every combined flow must have OnGlobalError wired. If multiple blueprints define error handling, merge into one error handler chain.

## Activity Quick Reference

One row per activity. Exit ports and required config extracted from `docs/reference/flow-designer-essentials.md` and `docs/reference/flow-designer-activities/`.

**Port name convention:** "Default" is the success path for most activities. "Error" is the system-error path. Activity-specific ports are listed explicitly. See the Port Name Canonical Map below for exact names per activity.

## Variable Naming Conventions

Standard variable names used across blueprints. Use these for consistency.

| Variable | Type | Used In | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| CallerANI | STRING | Most flows | Stores caller's phone number from `{{NewPhoneContact.ANI}}` |
| DNIS | STRING | DNIS routing | Stores dialed number from `{{NewPhoneContact.DNIS}}` |
| Global_Language | STRING (Global) | Multilingual | TTS language code (e.g., `en-US`, `es-US`) |
| Global_VoiceName | STRING (Global) | Multilingual | TTS voice name override |
| Global_FeedbackSurveyOptin | BOOLEAN (Global) | Post-call survey | Must be `true` before Feedback V2 executes |
| noInputCount | INTEGER | Menu retry | Counter for no-input retries |
| storeId | STRING | DNIS/data dip | Identifier from lookup |
| customerTier | STRING | Data dip + route | Customer tier from API response |
| VerifiedCount | INTEGER | CJDS verification | Result count from CJDS event query |
| RequiredSkill | STRING | Skill routing | Skill value for Queue Contact skill matching |
| event_name | STRING | Scripted AI fulfillment | State Event name to send back to agent |
| event_data | JSON | Scripted AI fulfillment | Parsed API response (counts toward 5 JSON limit) |
| event_data_string | STRING | Scripted AI fulfillment | Stringified event_data (VAV2 requires STRING) |
| PrimaryDN | STRING | Sequential transfer | Primary transfer destination |
| SecondaryDN | STRING | Sequential transfer | Secondary transfer destination |

### Variable Type Rules

| Type | Limits | Use For |
|------|--------|---------|
| STRING | No documented limit | Phone numbers, names, IDs, text |
| INTEGER | Standard integer range | Counters, priorities, status codes |
| BOOLEAN | true/false | Flags, toggles |
| DECIMAL | Standard decimal | Percentages, scores |
| DATE TIME | ISO-8601 formats | Timestamps, schedules |
| JSON | **Max 5 per flow, 16KB each** | Parsed API responses, complex data |
| Global STRING | Init: 256 chars, Runtime: 1024 chars | Reportable variables, shared config |

## TTS Connector Reference

| Connector | Setup | Language Support | Character Limit | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Cisco Cloud TTS | Default — no setup needed | Multiple (set via `Global_Language`) | None | Available on Next Gen voice platform |
| Google TTS | Requires ChirpTTS connector in Control Hub | Multiple | Not documented | Classic platform: Google TTS only |

**TTS in activities:** Play Message, Menu, and Collect Digits all support TTS prompts. Each supports:
- Speaking Rate: 0.25–4.0 wpm (default 1.0)
- Volume Gain: -96.0–16.0 dB (default 0.0)
- Override Default Language & Voice Settings toggle
- `{{variable}}` interpolation in TTS text
- SSML tags inside `<speak>` wrappers (Cisco TTS)

**Use single quotes** inside Pebble expressions in TTS text. Double quotes conflict with the expression parser.

## Common Design Gotchas

Issues to catch during design (before build).

| Gotcha | Wrong | Right | Why |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| Menu after Queue | Queue Contact → Menu | Menu → Queue Contact | Can't play menu while caller is in queue |
| Self-loop on Menu without counter | Menu Timeout → same Menu | Menu Timeout → SetVariable(count+1) → Condition(count<3) → Menu | Infinite loop with no exit |
| End Flow in main flow | Main path ends with End Flow | Main path ends with Disconnect Contact | End Flow doesn't hang up — caller hears dead air |
| Play Message only loop after Queue | Queue → Play Message → Play Message → ... | Queue → Play Music → Play Message → Play Music → ... | Must include Play Music in loop after Queue |
| HTTP Request right after Queue | Queue → HTTP Request | Queue → Play Message → HTTP Request | HTTP may fail due to timing |
| Missing OnGlobalError | No event handler wired | Play Message → Queue → Play Music → Disconnect | Errors silently drop calls |
| VAV2 after Queue Contact | Queue → VAV2 | VAV2 → Queue (on Escalated) | Unsupported configuration |
| VAV2 in Event Flow | AgentDisconnected → VAV2 | VAV2 in main flow only | Unsupported configuration |
| Variable Queue with skills | Variable Queue + Skill Requirements | Static Queue + Skill Requirements | Variable Queue ignores skills, uses LAA |
| JSON variable overuse | 6+ JSON variables | Max 5 JSON, use STRING + Parse for additional | Platform limit is 5 per flow, 16KB each |
| INTEGER for phone numbers | Phone: INTEGER type | Phone: STRING type | Leading zeros stripped, formatting lost |
| Missing Disconnect after Callback | Callback → (nothing) | Callback → Disconnect Contact | Call never ends without Disconnect |
| No CallbackFailed handler | Callback with no event handler | Wire CallbackFailed → Wait → Callback retry | Failed callbacks never retried |
| Priority outside 1-9 | Priority: 0 or 10+ | Priority: P1–P9 | Values outside 1–9 default to P10 (lowest) |
| Global Variable string too long | >1024 chars at runtime | Keep under 1024 chars | Exceeding causes call failures |
| Blind Transfer silence | Blind Transfer → (no comfort message) | Play Message → Blind Transfer | Caller hears dead air during transfer |
| Empty string comparison | `{{var == ""}}` in Condition | Use numeric check: `{{count > 0}}` | Empty string comparison unsupported |
| EWT returns -1 | Treat -1 as "short wait" | Handle as "unknown wait time" | -1 means insufficient data, not zero wait |

## Port Name Canonical Map

Port names for the design doc Connections table. These match the convention from `flow-designer-design-doc.md` and `build-spec-diagram/reference.md` PORT_DEFINITIONS — the standard error port is **"Error"** (not "Undefined Error"), and activity-specific ports use the simplified names below.

> The activity doc files in `docs/reference/flow-designer-activities/` use "Undefined Error" for the error path. The design doc template normalizes this to "Error" for consistency with the spec diagram generator. Use the names below in the design doc, not the activity doc names.

## Transfer Type Decision

| Choose | When | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Blind Transfer** | The destination always answers (e.g., another queue, a known extension), OR you don't need to handle transfer failure in the flow | Call leaves WxCC — simpler, no return path needed |
| **Bridged Transfer** | You need to handle no-answer/busy in the flow (e.g., try extension, on failure route to queue) | Call stays in WxCC — flow continues on failure |

Default to **Blind Transfer** unless the requirements explicitly mention fallback behavior on transfer failure.
